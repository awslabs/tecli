  Performing a run on a new configuration is a multi-step process.

    Create a configuration version on the workspace.
    Upload configuration files to the configuration version.
    Create a run on the workspace; this is done automatically when a configuration file is uploaded.
    Create and queue an apply on the run; if the run can't be auto-applied.

  Alternatively, you can create a run with a pre-existing configuration version, even one from another workspace. This is useful for promoting known good code from one workspace to another.
